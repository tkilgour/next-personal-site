A [nice article about 'Learn More' links](https://blog.1password.com/learn-more-content-design/) on the (usually) not-too-corporate 1Password blog.

> Screen readers can navigate to links without context. So ‘Learn More, link’ will be read out loud and mean nothing.

As the main champion of accessibile design at my work, I often find myself calling out these repetitive links (see also "Read More", "View More" and their ilk).

If I don't have the power to influence these links, my band-aid solution is to add in off-screen text. Works especially well for a component design where there is already a title that the "Learn More" is contextually referring to.
